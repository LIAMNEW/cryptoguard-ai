- **Instant parsing** of CSV and JSON files
- **Batch processing** - all transactions analyzed simultaneously
- **Results in seconds**, not minutes

## Supported File Formats
- âœ… CSV (.csv) - **Recommended**
- âœ… JSON (.json)
- ðŸ“¦ Max file size: 50MB

## How It Works

### 1. Upload Your Data
Drag/drop or select your file in the **Upload Data** section.

### 2. Instant Parsing
The system directly parses your file format:
- CSV: Comma-separated values
- JSON: Array of transaction objects
- Auto-detects common column name variations

### 3. AUSTRAC 8-Rule Risk Scoring
Each transaction is analyzed against 8 detection rules:

#### Rule 1: Large Transaction Detection (â‰¥$10,000)
- **Weight**: Up to 30 points
- **Trigger**: Transactions â‰¥ $10,000 AUD
- **AUSTRAC**: Threshold Transaction Report (TTR) required
- **Example**: $15,000 transaction = +15 points

#### Rule 2: Structuring Detection ($9,000-$10,000)
- **Weight**: 25 points
- **Trigger**: Amounts between $9,000 and $9,999
- **AUSTRAC**: Potential structuring to avoid reporting
- **Example**: $9,500 transaction = +25 points + flag

#### Rule 3: Round Amount Patterns
- **Weight**: 10 points
- **Trigger**: Exact multiples of $1,000 or $500
- **AUSTRAC**: Unusual transaction pattern
- **Example**: $5,000.00 or $10,000.00 = +10 points

#### Rule 4: High-Risk Jurisdictions
- **Weight**: 20 points
- **Trigger**: Transactions to/from: KY, PA, VG, BM, LI, MC, BS, TC, KP, IR, SY
- **AUSTRAC**: High-risk geographic location
- **Example**: Transfer to Cayman Islands (KY) = +20 points

#### Rule 5: Cash Transaction Detection
- **Weight**: 15 points
- **Trigger**: Cash-based transactions
- **AUSTRAC**: Physical currency transaction
- **Example**: Cash deposit = +15 points

#### Rule 6: Sanctions/PEP Screening
- **Weight**: 35 points
- **Trigger**: Matches sanctions lists or Politically Exposed Persons
- **AUSTRAC**: Sanctions screening hit or PEP identified
- **Example**: PEP match = +35 points + mandatory flag

#### Rule 7: Velocity Anomaly Detection
- **Weight**: Up to 20 points
- **Trigger**: >5 transactions from same address in 24 hours
- **AUSTRAC**: Unusual transaction frequency
- **Example**: 8 transactions in 24h = +20 points

#### Rule 8: KYC Inconsistency Checks
- **Weight**: Up to 15 points
- **Trigger**: Incomplete data, unusual patterns
- **AUSTRAC**: Customer due diligence concerns
- **Example**: Large transfer with minimal data = +15 points

## Risk Classification

### High Risk (SMR) - Score â‰¥70
- **Action Required**: Suspicious Matter Report within 3 business days
- **Indicators**: Multiple red flags, mandatory triggers (structuring, sanctions)
- **Monitoring**: Immediate escalation and enhanced surveillance

### Medium Risk (EDD) - Score 40-69
- **Action Required**: Enhanced Due Diligence procedures
- **Indicators**: One or more significant risk factors
- **Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring and documentation

### Low Risk (Normal) - Score <40
- **Action Required**: Standard Customer Due Diligence
- **Indicators**: Minor or no risk factors
- **Monitoring**: Regular monitoring sufficient

## Sample CSV File Format

**Minimum required: amount column**

**Recommended columns:**
```csv
transaction_id,from_address,to_address,amount,timestamp,transaction_type,currency
TX001,client_123,merchant_456,9500,2025-01-15 10:30:00,transfer,AUD
TX002,client_789,offshore_KY,15000,2025-01-15 11:00:00,wire,AUD
TX003,client_456,panama_PA,10000,2025-01-15 13:45:00,wire,AUD
```

**Column Auto-Detection:**
The system recognizes these variations:
- `from_address`, `from`, `sender`, `source` â†’ from_address
- `to_address`, `to`, `recipient`, `destination` â†’ to_address
- `transaction_id`, `id`, `txn_id` â†’ transaction_id
- `timestamp`, `date`, `time` â†’ timestamp

## Example Scores

| Transaction | Amount | Factors | Score | Risk Level |
|-------------|--------|---------|-------|------------|
| TX001 | $9,500 | Structuring | 25 | LOW |
| TX002 | $15,000 | Large + High-risk country | 35 | LOW |
| TX003 | $500 | None | 0 | LOW |
| TX004 | $10,000 | Large + Round + Cash + High-risk | 60 | MEDIUM (EDD) |
| TX005 | $25,000 | Large + Round | 35 | LOW |
| TX006 | $50,000 | Very large + High-risk country | 50 | MEDIUM (EDD) |
| TX007 | $9,800 | Structuring | 25 | LOW |

## Best Practices

### Data Quality
- âœ… Include transaction IDs for tracking
- âœ… Provide timestamps for velocity analysis
- âœ… Include destination countries for jurisdiction checks
- âœ… Specify transaction types (cash, wire, transfer)

### Regular Monitoring
- Upload new data daily or weekly
- Compare risk trends over time
- Review high-risk transactions immediately
- Document all SMR-level findings

### Compliance
- Investigate all SMR-level transactions within 3 days
- Apply EDD procedures for medium-risk transactions
- Maintain audit trail of all analyses
- Keep export reports for regulatory review

## Troubleshooting

### "No transactions found"
- Ensure file is CSV or JSON format
- Check that 'amount' column exists
- Verify file is not empty

### "Upload failed"
- Check file size is under 50MB
- Ensure file is not corrupted
- Try uploading a smaller batch

### Performance Tips
- CSV format is fastest for large files
- Split files >10,000 transactions for best performance
- Use simple column names (amount, from, to)
